All of our welders are AWS certified. Each tower is supervised during production and inspected by an independent AWS certified welding inspector upon completion. Thick parts are pre-heated prior to welding to prevent laminar tearing and minimize weld shrinkage stress. Tower sections are very precisely fabricated with the use of specially designed fit-up jigs to insure that tower member assembly is plumb, square, and true to line. We fabricate a diverse variety of steel, aluminum, and magnesium structures and structural components. We are often asked to be creative in bringing a client's vision into reality. Magnum can provide antenna mounts, roof top tower support frameworks, OSHA approved climbing ladders, gin poles (steel or magnesium) waveguide support brackets, and much more. </p> <button class="button-fabrication hidden-button menu-button"> Close </button> </div> <div class="drop-down-menu hidden" id="installation"> <p class="product-paragraph"> When the time comes to install your tower, you can count on us.
